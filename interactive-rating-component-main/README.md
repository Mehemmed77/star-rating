## My process

### Built with

- [HTML5]
- [CSS]
- Mainly [Flexbox]
- @media queries
- [VanillaJS]
- [Events]

### What I learned

This was some kind of practise for me but i learnt to use css classes more efficently and 
wrote simple short readable css code which is mainly the thing that i'm mostly proud of

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div onclick='someFunction()' 
onmouseover='some_other_function()'
onmouseleave='someotherotherfunction()'></div>
```
### Continued development

i couldn't figure out a way to do hover and click (i mean effects) together with only css (ofc i know :hover pseudo class) if someone has done it i would like to know thanks!

### Feedback From @LozPilafas

users can press submit button without actually selecting rating and this was issue that needed to be fixed! thanks @LozPilafas;Also i added feature that you can unselect the 
rating you've selected which is good thing i think.HAVE FUN!
